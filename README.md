Use the following command in your terminal to install the persistent storage plugin for Vagrant:
```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-persistent-storage
```

### 4. Start up your EPrints-box

Your should already have a copy of your EPrints-box repository already.

In your terminal, go to the folder where the EPrints-box is then run `vagrant up`.
Within a few minutes, your repository is then up and running.

Example
```bash
cd eprints-box-<version>
vagrant up
```

If this is really your first time ever and you have no EPrints-box repository yet, download a fresh box from https://github.com/rorasa/eprints-box/releases . In this case please follow the steps in **Create your repository** topic first before proceeding to the next step.

### 5. Setting your host

An EPrints repository is required to have its own domain name. Suppose your repository's domain is *your.repository.domain*, please map this domain to 192.168.33.10 in your machine's host setting.

**In Linux or MAC** Add the domain to your `/etc/hosts`.

Example

```bash
echo "192.168.33.10     your.repository.domain | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

**In Windows**

1. Start Notepad.exe as Administrator.
2. Using Notepad, open C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts
3. Add `192.168.33.10     your.repository.domain` to the last line. Save the file.

### 6. Access your repository

Open your web browser. Type in `your.repository.domain` (don't forget to change this to your real domain) into the browser URL box. Suppose that the repository is already created, the homepage of EPrints should show up. Enjoy!

## Day-to-day use of EPrints-box

Now that you have everything setup, to use EPrints-box in a normal day-to-day fashion is easy.

### Start repository server

Just go to your EPrints-box folder and run `vagrant up`

Example
```bash
cd eprints-box-<version>
vagrant up
```

### Access your repository

Just open your web browser and type in your repository's domain.

### Stop repository server

When you'd like to shutdown the repository server, you have a few options to choose from.

`vagrant suspend` suspends your virtual machine and leaves both the machine itself and its memory state in your harddisk. It is the fastest way to shut it down and boot it up again. However, it uses the biggest amount of disk space on your machine.

`vagrant halt` leaves the virtual machine in your machine after cleanly shut it down first. It is not as fast as the suspend option but requires less disk space.

`vagrant destroy` removes your virtual machine completely. This is the slowest option because a new virtual machine must be copied again at start up. However it takes no more space apart from the EPrint-box data. Your repository data is *not* removed when perform this destroy option.
